    "4. Assess the model\n",
    "5. Test the model on the test corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: Bag-of-words\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ".. Note:: Feel free to skip these review sections if you're already familiar with the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familiar with the `bag-of-words model\n",
    "<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model>`_ from the\n",
    "`core_concepts_vector` section.\n",
    "This model transforms each document to a fixed-length vector of integers.\n",
    "For example, given the sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.``\n",
    "- ``John also likes to watch football games. Mary hates football.``\n",
    "\n",
    "The model outputs the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]``\n",
    "- ``[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]``\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector has 10 elements, where each element counts the number of times a\n",
    "particular word occurred in the document.\n",
    "The order of elements is arbitrary.\n",
    "In the example above, the order of the elements corresponds to the words:\n",
    "``[\"John\", \"likes\", \"to\", \"watch\", \"movies\", \"Mary\", \"too\", \"also\", \"football\", \"games\", \"hates\"]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag-of-words models are surprisingly effective, but have several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they lose all information about word order: \"John likes Mary\" and\n",
    "\"Mary likes John\" correspond to identical vectors. There is a solution: bag\n",
    "of `n-grams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram>`__\n",
    "models consider word phrases of length n to represent documents as\n",
    "fixed-length vectors to capture local word order but suffer from data\n",
    "sparsity and high dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the model does not attempt to learn the meaning of the underlying\n",
    "words, and as a consequence, the distance between vectors doesn't always\n",
    "reflect the difference in meaning.  The ``Word2Vec`` model addresses this\n",
    "second problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review: ``Word2Vec`` Model\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "``Word2Vec`` is a more recent model that embeds words in a lower-dimensional\n",
    "vector space using a shallow neural network. The result is a set of\n",
    "word-vectors where vectors close together in vector space have similar\n",
    "meanings based on context, and word-vectors distant to each other have\n",
    "differing meanings. For example, ``strong`` and ``powerful`` would be close\n",
    "together and ``strong`` and ``Paris`` would be relatively far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gensim's :py:class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec` class implements this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the ``Word2Vec`` model, we can calculate the vectors for each **word** in a document.\n",
    "But what if we want to calculate a vector for the **entire document**\\ ?\n",
    "We could average the vectors for each word in the document - while this is quick and crude, it can often be useful.\n",
    "However, there is a better way...\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing: Paragraph Vector\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    ".. Important:: In Gensim, we refer to the Paragraph Vector model as ``Doc2Vec``.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le and Mikolov in 2014 introduced the `Doc2Vec algorithm <https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf>`__, which usually outperforms such simple-averaging of ``Word2Vec`` vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is: act as if a document has another floating word-like\n",
    "vector, which contributes to all training predictions, and is updated like\n",
    "other word-vectors, but we will call it a doc-vector. Gensim's\n",
    ":py:class:`~gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec` class implements this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Memory (PV-DM)\n",
    "2. Paragraph Vector - Distributed Bag of Words (PV-DBOW)\n",
    "\n",
    ".. Important::\n",
    "  Don't let the implementation details below scare you.\n",
    "  They're advanced material: if it's too much, then move on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "PV-DM is analogous to Word2Vec CBOW. The doc-vectors are obtained by training\n",
    "a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a center word based an\n",
    "average of both context word-vectors and the full document's doc-vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "PV-DBOW is analogous to Word2Vec SG. The doc-vectors are obtained by training\n",
    "a neural network on the synthetic task of predicting a target word just from\n",
    "the full document's doc-vector. (It is also common to combine this with\n",
    "skip-gram testing, using both the doc-vector and nearby word-vectors to\n",
    "predict a single target word, but only one at a time.)\n",
    "\n",
