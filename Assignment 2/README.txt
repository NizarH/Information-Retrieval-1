## File structure

The files are structured in the following way:
- main folder: contains all the code to run search functions
- datasets: contains all the data used to run the program ** (download this with download_ap.py and read_ap.py)
- pickles: contains all pkl files
- results: contains all the results in .json and .txt files
- results/TREC_files: contains all the TREC files for every search function
- assignment: IR1_Assignment2.pdf

## Running the program

Install python version 3.7
Install Ubuntu 18.04
Install pytrec_eval

Install packages in requirements.txt

** Please download the datasets first with download_ap.py and read_ap.py. The .zip folder was too big to submit with the datasets in it. **

In order to run the program the user should run every python file separately using "python3 {filename}.py".
